# Ames House Price Prediction: A Comprehensive Analysis

This repository provides a detailed examination of the Ames Housing dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock, using the Lasso Regression model. The project is designed to predict the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, through a step-by-step application of essential Data Science techniques.

Project Lifecycle:

  1. Data Analysis: An exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the nature and structure of the data.

  2. Feature Engineering: This step involves preprocessing and cleaning of the dataset, followed by generating new features to improve the model's performance.

  3. Feature Selection: Features that significantly affect the target variable are selected to reduce noise and improve training efficiency.

  4. Model Building: The Lasso Regression model is used to predict the final price of the houses.
  
  5. Model Deployment: The trained model is then deployed to make real-world predictions.

With these methodologies, the model has achieved an impressive prediction accuracy of 81%. This project offers a rich experience of creative feature engineering and advanced regression techniques, while also bringing a modernized perspective to house price prediction challenges, beyond the traditional Boston Housing dataset.
